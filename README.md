## About

Hi, I'm Diana!

I began my career as an Industrial Designer, and my journey has taken me through various fascinating roles, including a Web Development Bootcamp, where I transitioned into a UI/UX Designer and later became a Project Manager. Currently, I am working as a Business Analyst, where my love for organization and design has naturally evolved into a passion for data. I enjoy creating visually beautiful dashboards in Power BI and designing Google Sheets templates for my Etsy store.

I hold an MBA in Business Intelligence and have taken the initiative to teach myself Power BI and some DAX, among other tools. While I don't consider myself an expert in any area, I pride myself on being an expert researcher—using Google and other resources to solve problems and acquire the necessary skills.

In my free time, I love exploring new coffee shops, baking, and exploring new data visualization techniques and tools, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I am driven by the excitement of uncovering insights from data and the satisfaction of creating organized, effective solutions.
